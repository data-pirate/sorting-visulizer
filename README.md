### ðŸš€ Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

**Project Description:**
Sorting Algorithms Visualizer is an interactive web application designed to help users understand and visualize various sorting algorithms. This tool offers a hands-on approach to learning, allowing users to see how different algorithms work in real-time. The visualizer is built using modern web technologies and provides an engaging and educational experience for both beginners and experienced programmers.

**Key Features:**
- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch how different sorting algorithms work step-by-step in real-time.
- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose from a variety of sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Heap Sort.
- **Customizable Array Size and Speed**: Adjust the size of the array and the speed of the visualization to match your learning pace.
- **Step-by-Step Explanation**: Detailed explanations accompany each step of the sorting process, helping users understand the logic behind each algorithm.
- **Pause and Resume**: Control the visualization with pause, resume, and reset options for better learning and observation.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: React.js for reactive UI components
- **Styling**: CSS3 for sleek and responsive design

**How It Works:**
1. **Select an Algorithm**: Choose your desired sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
2. **Set Parameters**: Adjust the array size and visualization speed using the provided sliders.
3. **Start Visualization**: Click the 'Start' button to begin the visualization. Watch as the algorithm sorts the array in real-time.
4. **Interactive Controls**: Use the pause, resume, and reset buttons to control the visualization as needed.
5. **Learn and Explore**: Follow the step-by-step explanations and observe the performance metrics to gain a deeper understanding of each sorting algorithm.

**Project Goals:**
- **Educational Tool**: Provide a clear and interactive way to learn and understand different sorting algorithms.
- **Engagement**: Create an engaging and fun learning experience for users of all levels.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the tool is accessible and easy to use for everyone, regardless of their background in computer science.

**Usage:**
- **Students**: Ideal for computer science students who want to learn and visualize how sorting algorithms work.
- **Educators**: A useful tool for teachers and professors to demonstrate sorting algorithms in a classroom setting.
- **Hobbyists**: Perfect for coding enthusiasts and hobbyists looking to deepen their understanding of sorting algorithms.

**Future Enhancements:**
